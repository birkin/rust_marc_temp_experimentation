- goal play:
    - first, to load a file of marc-records, and create a list of titles.
    - then, to do the same for a path to a directory of marc files.

- flow...
    - played around with rust-marc but was having trouble pulling out specific data.
    - so am now experimenting with how marc_cli calls rust-marc.

- notes...
    - the combined file is 233MB, and yields 195,190 marc records.
